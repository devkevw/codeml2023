# PolyAI's CodeML Hackathon 2023
## Team Members: Daniel Cho, Kevin Wang

Winners of Environment and Climate Change Canada's challenge in the detection of hail and thunderstorm!

The annual hackathon in machine learning and AI hosted by PolyAI at Polytechnique Montreal composed of 6 challenges of varying difficulty. One of these challenges was presented by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) and involded predicting the presence of hail, thunderstorm and severe hail based on certain other meteorolical factors. With the given data, we constructed a machile learning model based on decision-tree based techniques. Our model scored an accuracy of 100% and placed us first!

We also attempted SBQuantum's challenge in predicting the magnetic field variation caused by temperature and current variations in a quantum magnetometer. We sought to employ a multiple linear regression as the basis for our model, but our efforts were unable to take home the top prize.
